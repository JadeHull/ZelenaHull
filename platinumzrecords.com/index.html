<h2>About Us</h2>
    <pre>
This is the in house label for Independent musician Zelena Hull. Our catalog currently contains her works which are country, Americana, rock, pop, electronic, and many more. Edward Hull (CEO) and Zelena Hull (artist and marketing strategist) currently direct this record label and publishing company.

We have worked with many different musicians and producers in recording her tracks and voice. Some of the amazing talent we have had the honor of creating with are: Mike Schrimpf (who has worked with Conway Twitty, Loretta Lynn, George Jones, and more), Mr. Steve Hinson (One of Nashville’s most requested players), Grammy players, and some members of the house band for the Grand Ole Opry. She has also worked with Katlin Owen who is the guitarist for country music singer RaeLynn.

Music runs in the family. Our history involves Zelena’s great grandmother being among the earliest alumni of The Julliard School of Music. Zelena’s Great grandfather Edward Wicks was a luthier who restored the infamous violin belonging to Joshua Bell. Zelena’s father Edward said he remembers his grandfather showing him a violin he rebuilt in the mid 1980’s and playing it very briefly to show him how beautiful it sounded. He would not let him play it and was careful with it. It may be the same violin. On 28 February 1936 the violin was stolen from Bronisław Huberman while playing at Carnegie Hall by a young musician named Julian Altman. Altman asked his grandfather to rebuild the violin and later on his deathbed confessed that he had stolen it from Huberman. It was later turned over to the Lloyd’s of London who had paid $30,000 on the claim after the theft. The violin was sold to British violinist Norbert Brainin for $1.2 million. He later sold it to Joshua Bell for $4 million. The violin can be heard in soundtracks in the movie ‘The Da Vinci Code ‘, the movie ‘Angels and Demons’, and ‘The Red Violin’. The violin is now named ‘Gibson ex Huberman‘ and is worth $14 million. You can hear the composition by Hans Zimmer and Joshua Bell <a rel = "noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/oayr0X3qS48?si=9b1Z9b1oQA4Ko0rK" target="_blank">on Youtube</a>.

<h4>Family History</h4>
<pre>

Edward's (Zelena's father) maternal family history includes a Great Grand Father (William Wicks) who served on President Roosevelt’s wartime production board. He was one of the pioneers of the American Welding Society and helped pioneer the gas welding process. He developed several tools for gas welding. He trained welders at his welding school in New York for the Brooklyn Ship yards. There were approximately over 200,000 combat repairs by these welders and other staff. His sister in law Mary Wicks also is the sister of German Industrialist Robert Bosch. Robert Bosch at the same time was opposed to the war efforts by Hitler and is known for helping Jews escape. His humanitarian views and efforts are well known.

Edwards paternal family includes his grandfather Charles Henry Hull who was born in 1903. During world war 1 he enlisted in the U.S. Army with the help of his sister who lied to recruiters and said he was 18 years old. He was 15 at the time of his enlistment.

He was a member of the Service Company of the 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division and was taken as a prisoner of war on July 29th 1950. He remains in unknown status in present day.

Edward’s wife Valerie is a fine artist and sculptor. In 2006 Valerie and Edward teamed up with locals in the community to fight an out of state waste landfill planned for their local community. They targeted a town that was within 5 miles of another mega landfill and had a significantly elderly citizenship. Valerie donated art that was used for a drawing. Funds from the drawing paid all legal fees and representation for the small town. They ran the internet campaign and met with lawmakers in the S.C. House of Representatives and educated the public to win their support. They and the others who fought are one of the only successful campaigns to stop the waste industry in the US.

They have been married for over 25 years and had Zelena as their first and only child. Valerie helped Zelena develop her artistry and has been the catalyst in growing Zelena’s talent. Little known to most people, Zelena also has the gift of artistic abilities from her mother.
