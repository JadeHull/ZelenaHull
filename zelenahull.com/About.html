Zelena created her first two singles “Serious” and “I Believe” with track recording done with Dan Caston. He also contributed to 3 songs on “6ft Under”, the EP “In Love You”, and “Hey Girls” of of the EP Hello. He is an awesome musician, who can play in various styles. She first came in contact with him to learn piano and that evolved into the creation of my first song. After working with him for a few sessions he noticed her desire to sing. He would play with her and then they started making up fun songs together. Dan had his band (named Blind Vision) booked at a local event and invited Zelena to come see them play.

When Zelena showed up to the event, Dan decided to let her on stage and sing. After that she was hooked and knew she wanted to be a musician. She told her mother that Dan was like sunshine, and made her so happy. Zelena wanted to make other people feel like that.

Doomed Duck~ Highly inspired by the corruption that leads to recessions or depressions, this song has a bleeding edge cutting deep into the hearts of the unaware. People are forced to participate in a system they actively despise. Greed actively works against the communal nature of humanity. This song is a critique of the system that is used to fill the void. We constantly set ourselves up for collapse constantly, to the point were it’s a given. This hard-rock song is dynamic yet consistent, dark and yet hopeful, gritty and yet graceful. I have many references sprinkled in the lyrics I hope you enjoy.


Hey Girls~ This song is about taking revenge and control of the situation. Don’t let yourself be walked on over by other people, you have to take a stand for yourself. Hey Girls addresses sexism and basis. Our protagonist goes from taking it to dishing it out to those who deserve it. It’s a girl power southern rock song to put on after a nasty break up.

<h4>Doomed Duck</h4>Doomed Duck sitting on the concrete
Sound of a Gun shot going on Wall St
Side line picking up going on Friday
Limit it all till the sun, till the sun don't come

Lady lace tripping on a phone chord
water funnels up and down again
Double standard everything up and down again, again
lucky duck run away come back another day, day

Hello it's starring at you, but you don't wanna see it cause it hurts
Hello but it'll hurt everyone else if you don't look it up
Sound of the Gunshot, duck on the concrete 
Just another day on wall st
Sound of the Gunshot, duck on the concrete 
Just another day on wall st

Innocent, No wait it isn't, law and order renamed. 
The guilty ones aren't the ones who are blamed. 
Nothing is true anymore, money gets you the higher score
Stop lying it's tearing you up more and more and more

Hello it's starring at you, but you don't wanna see it cause it hurts
Hello but it'll hurt everyone else if you don't look it up
Sound of the Gunshot, duck on the concrete 
Just another day on wall st
Sound of the Gunshot, duck on the concrete 
Just another day on wall st

I tried can't be denied, this fire inside
My heart is burning into a ball of fire
Judgement on those who don't deserve it
The 1% gets all of it!

Hello it's starring at you, but you don't wanna see it cause it hurts
Hello but it'll hurt everyone else if you don't look it up
Sound of the Gunshot, duck on the concrete 
Just another day on wall st
Sound of the Gunshot, duck on the concrete 
Just another day on wall st
<h4>Hey Girls</h4>Hey girls were gonna get them back
for running around talking smack
you see them grinning they think there winning
but the ladies have stopped forgiving

you never know if there fake or real or how many hearts they have to steal
don't know how much more I can take when they drive in that stake...

I've had men lie straight to my face
then spit in it and call me a disgrace
say no woman should go around hunting 
that's for men, that's for men...

you never know if there fake or real or how many hearts they have to steal
don't know how much more I can take when they drive in that stake...

I'm gonna prove that a woman can break a heart just like a man can
I'll find them anywhere stab them in the back
I'll do whatever I have to, to get this broken heart back
I'll glue together pieces and make it fit some how...

you never know if I'm fake or real or how many hearts I have to steal
don't know how much more they can take when I drive in that stake...

you never know if I'm fake or real or how many hearts I have to steal
don't know how much more They can take when I drive in that stake...

<pre>

Just a Cinderella Story~ If your naive you can be easily taken advantage of. This song is about a young woman being fooled into a relationship by a slick boy toy. Looks can fool and going head first into something without taking the time for yourself is a bad idea. Life isn’t a fairly tale ending and your going to set yourself up for failure if that is what you expect. You shouldn’t project your expectations onto others, because that is a recipe for toxicity. Pop country.

Joyride~ Sometimes things don’t go anywhere and that is true for relationships too. It’s easier to drown our sorrows than to confront them head on. Joyride is about a woman not being able to let go her past. She would rather pretend her relationship is going great than to actually address the underlining issues. This is a classic country song with track contributions from Mike Schrimpf, Mr. Steve Hinson, Grammy players, and some house band members for the Grand Ole Opry.

<h4>Just A Cinderella Story</h4>Just another cookie cutter Cinderella barbie, thinking some little magic will happen
that beautiful prince charming, will come save me oh baby...

She feel in love too young... her innocence was gone... does she not know
that the cold will make her heart blue.

Just a Cinderella story have the prince come save me...
oh well he didn't come. you though it would a fairy book ending
were the queen meets her king... well guess what your endings all wrong

The pretty pretty prince has no common sense, only picks those he walk over
you might be a little naive, but its not that hard to conceive

He will cheat, he will lie, that you can't deny
there ain't no reason other than his ego
He'll off your stock if you get what I mean

Just a Cinderella story have the prince come save me...
oh well he didn't come. you though it would a fairy book ending
were the queen meets her king... well guess what your endings all wrong

Just a Cinderella story have the prince come save me...
oh well he didn't come. you though it would a fairy book ending
were the queen meets her king... well guess what your endings all wrong
<h4>Joyride</h4>They say you have eyes that you’ve been battin’
One for one tit for tat, none of the love is coming back

Take em’ for a joy ride, promise them a good time every Saturday night
But the feeling ain’t right, feeling alone tonight

Take a lot of care, wait somewhere, Thinking he might come, 
when he’s gone, you don’t belong, but you don’t love him

Take em’ for a joy ride, promise them a good time every Saturday night
But the feeling ain’t right, feeling alone tonight

You hope one day, your sadness will go away
By drowning in false hopes and piecing together broken dreams

Take em’ for a joy ride, promise them a good time every Saturday night
But the feeling ain’t right, feeling alone tonight
Take em’ for a joy ride, promise them a good time every Saturday night
But the feeling ain’t right, Still feeling alone tonight
Take em’ for a joy ride, promise them a good time every Saturday night

These are both fun country love songs. In Love With You talks about how the simple pleasures make live amazing. If it’s the love poem then Country Boy is the meet cute/flirt that started it all. It makes puns about American culture and norms in a fun a light heart-ed way.

<h4>In Love With You</h4>Nothing else has gone my way until you came here to stay
I love life and don't be surprised to hear me say. 

The sweet smell of hickory, your hand oh touching my knee
I can do this all the time, it's all up to you baby

Only live one life, so don't think too hard 
All I wanna do is be in love with you
In love with you

Only live one life, so don't think too hard 
All I wanna do is be in love with you
In love with you

Give me some of that and I could pretend 
I hadn't had it yet and we could do it again
At the lake nothing else to do, all I wanna do is have some fun with you
All you wanna do is stay here with me
We'll watch the fire flys, in the back of your truck
Don't be surprised to hear me say 

Only live one life, so don't think too hard 
All I wanna do is be in love with you
In love with you

Only live one life, so don't think too hard 
All I wanna do is be in love with you
In love with you
<h4>Country Boy</h4>Hey I see them boots you got on, I see they from China
I see that they are plether, I wanna man with real leather
pick me up and toss me around, slap them boots on the ground

I wanna country boy, someone I can enjoy
Don't wanna chillized boy toy, I wanna real man
I wanna country boy, someone I can enjoy
No No chillized boy toy, I wanna real man

I wanna strong back, not wearing a straw hat
I'm not into that, into that
I wanna man who can pick me up and rock me in a country world
Cause I'm a read hot USDA American Girl

I wanna country boy, someone I can enjoy
Don't wanna chillized boy toy, I wanna real man
I wanna country boy, someone I can enjoy
No No chillized boy toy, I wanna real man

My parent’s and I call this the sin album. I talk about many issues including unfair treatment, the inability to live up to expectations, and the inner nature of people. The best stories have a moral lesson to them and I wanted to incorporate that lesson here.

<h3 >EP Six Feet Under song breakdown</h3>
<pre class="presty">6ftunder~ People unfairly judge others. 6Ft under is about trying to claw your way out of a bad situation. This song addresses the fact that people will find a reason to dislike you and no matter what you do there’s some people you will never please. “Run like hell it ain’t a spell Warlock’s thumb, oh don’t be dumb” This line references the Salem witch trails. Often when someone was born with two thumbs they were considered a witch. You have to embrace the fact that there’s no way to be universally liked by everyone. There’s no way to control someone else’s thoughts or words, but you can control your own. 6Ftunder also points out the hypocrisy that unpins the morality of judgmental people. True for me, but not for thee.

Born and Raised~ This song is about struggle between the darkest and lightest part of ourselves. The inner demons we wrestle with at night, the dark thoughts that creep into the back of our minds, and the inability to live up to other people’s expectations. No matter how much you try sometimes things don’t work out. This song also addresses the larger societal issue of the lack of care others take. Most people stay in their own little world and don’t care about yours. Something might seem huge to you, but other people wouldn’t even notice it.

Fire~ If you judge solely on looks, you’ll be solely disappointed. Deceit, loneliness, innocence, and desperation can lead anyone into making a bad choice. In Fire a young man is enamored by a beauty, while his best friend is trying to talk him out of it. Even if she looks nice, it can be too good to be true. In this case it is. She is known to hurt you in any possible way, however it does not deter him. He falls deeply in love and she starts to take advantage of him, because he is unable to see the true monster underneath. This song represents his friend’s last attempt to reason with him. Don’t judge a book by it’s cover.

Time~ Timing something can be hard. It never know if your late or it’s too soon. This song is about how often people can have remorse to things they say yes to in the moment. When there’s a big decision to be made you need to contemplate it. Don’t rush and don’t be emotional when making your mind up. There needs to be objectivity when planing the future. It’s a hard thing to do but you need to keep your heart out of decisions and learn to take rejection. This song also tackles the subject of not knowing whether someone likes you, or if you’ve made them uncomfortable.

Walk On By~ This song is about feeling left behind by other people. Live moves on whether you want it to or not. You have to understand how to live for you in a compassionate way. Even if everyone else does not care, that does not mean you shouldn’t either. Sometimes you got to cut off your darker emotions and look at yourself objectively. Walk On By means to understand that if someone isn’t with you, don’t dwell on it or take it as a personal attack. You need to live for you, help others, and if someone else doesn’t like you, so be it.

<h4>6ft under</h4>I was born six feet under
Now I’m running for cover
I’ve been digging forever
Before I’m a goner

Tow down into the ground
They say missy you’ve been messing around
But I’m not doing anything
Boy words can sting

Run like hell it ain’t a spell
Warlock’s thumb, oh don’t be dumb
Messing some place, I haven’t been
When you’re the one who’s sinned

I was born six feet under
Now I’m running for cover
I’ve been digging forever
Before I’m a goner

They call me bad news
But all I’ve doing is singing the blues
And boy I ain’t gonna lose
There ain’t no point in going back
There ain’t no return
There’s no redemption here
I’m not going down 

I was born six feet under
Now I’m running for cover
I’ve been digging forever
Before I’m a goner

I was born six feet under
Now I’m running for cover
I’ve been digging forever
Before I’m a goner
<h4>Born and Raised</h4>I was born and I was raised to be good always
But where oh where did I go so wrong

Save my brother, love my mother 
That’s what it’s always been
But it’s hard to do good 
When everyone else surrenders to their sins

I was born and I was raised to be good always
But where oh where did I go so wrong

Oh life my sympathies for I’ve made many enemies
I’ve tried to do better, even though most will never care
It’s worth it’s weight in gold

I was born and I was raised to be good always
But where oh where did I go so wrong

Crumbling at the seams, my darkest sins deep in my dreams
It’s hard to be good even though you know you should

Save my brother, love my mother 
That’s what it’s always been
But it’s hard to do good 
When everyone else surrenders to their sins

I was born and I was raised to be good always
But where oh where did I go so wrong
<h4>Fire</h4>Face like an angel, Tricks like a demon
Gonna leave you dreaming
Gonna start screaming and aching, thinking about her
Boy playing with fire 
Fire fire fire

She’ll sweep off your feet, but she ain’t an angel
Everyone has bad and good but she ain’t doing what she should
Boy she’ll sweep you off your feet, but your bound to hit the ground.
Don’t matter how much you love her, boy your playing with fire.

Face like an angel, Tricks like a demon
Gonna leave you dreaming
Gonna start screaming and aching, thinking about her
Boy playing with fire

She’ll make you feel special, then break you in two
You have no idea what she has in store for you
You don’t know her, the best I can tell you now
Is don’t love her she’s playing with fire!

Face like an angel, Tricks like a demon
Gonna leave you dreaming
Gonna start screaming and aching, thinking about her
Face like an angel, Tricks like a demon
Gonna leave you dreaming
Gonna start screaming and aching, thinking about her
Boy playing with fire
Fire fire fire fire

Burn Burn
<h4>Time</h4>Take it easy, one step at a time he says to me
Bad intentions accidental romance
I can see it now, won’t leave me alone
Could I be wrong time’s funny that way
Confused or spinning on the top of my head
Gonna say he’s gonna regret it
Time will take it’s course 
And we will all have remorse

There’s a time for love and a time for hate
But you never know when it’s too late
Or when you passed the line
It gets harder every time. 
Going oh… not another…oh
No no no… not another one

Don’t blow it, control it
Keep saying that
Bad relations 
Same thing over and over

There’s a time for love and a time for hate
But you never know when it’s too late
Or when you passed the line
It gets harder every time.

I can see it now
Won’t let me go
Hard to get
Maybe time will regret it

There’s a time for love and a time for hate
But you never know when it’s too late
Or when you passed the line
It gets harder every time.
There’s a time for love and a time for hate
But you never know when it’s too late
Or when you passed the line
It gets harder every time.
Hummm….
Oh…..
No…
<h4>Walk On By</h4>For a long while I was stranger
Then I stumbled again and now your my friend
But now I’ve fallen flat on my face again
I hope this failure will end

I’m tired of every waking moment destroying my life. 
I’m tired of every heart break got to go through, cuts me like a knife
Then forget me again, how could this be
Maybe this is my destiny to walk on by

Good things bad things what’s the difference
Cause I’m always the bad one
Even if I’m not the one who shot the gun
I’m falling flat on my face

I’m tired of every waking moment destroying my life. 
I’m tired of every heart break got to go through, cuts me like a knife
Then forget me again, how could this be
Maybe this is my destiny to walk on by

Friends enemies can you give me room please
Hurt bleeding nobody cares
Unless they’ve fallen flat on their face
No matter what I do, there’s always people that’ll hate you
Oh
I’m tired of every waking moment destroying my life. 
I’m tired of every heart break got to go through, cuts me like a knife
Then forget me again, how could this be
Maybe this is my destiny to walk on by
walk on by
walk on by
walk on by

<pre>

Inspired by history, I Believe is about the world war 1 soccer game between the British and Germans. It is somber, dark, and yet hopeful. Even with all the suffering both sides went through they could lay down their weapons in the spirit of giving. In any bad situation there is always a sliver lining. Imagine how beautiful this world could be if the powers that be could allow us to embrace our humanity. This song has a haunting atmosphere and pumps it into high gear with the addition of a clear and crisp acoustic guitar. Silent night can be distantly heard in the background. This song carries a sense of strength and fragility.

<h3 >"I Believe" and the story that inspired it</h3>
<pre class="presty">
This song is about the Christmas Truce of 1914. In 1914 during World War 1 the Pope sought a truce on Christmas day but the waring nations refused to give in. Soldiers were trained that fraternization with the enemy was an act of treason. On Christmas Eve the British and Germans over heard one another singing “Silent Night.” They started singing louder and louder which lead to a cease fire. The song is based on this true story of the German and British troops on the front lines in Europe. Afterward they began giving each other small gifts, sharing supplies, food, medical supplies, and even had a good will soccer game.
The backdrop is a beautiful haunting melody that sets the stage. As the song starts it describes the wars horrific conditions. Then it transforms into a mesmerizing song of hope as it describes “two arcs drawn in Deadman’s land” symbolizing each soldier telling the opposing forces I am a Christian, Merry Christmas. This is symbolic of each other’s faith that became the Christmas Truce of 1914 and ends in restored faith in humanity.

More about the production of I believe:

“On November 12th we finished mastering the song in Nashville”, said Edward Hull, president of Platinum Z Records. “ We had just finished up our finalizing for Zelena’s new EP titled ‘6 Feet Under’ when we decided we also needed to push for the release of her new Christmas song ‘I Believe’. Once we heard the preliminary drafts we knew we had to move quickly. We called Kenny Lee, who is a good friend of ours in Nashville and I asked if he could immediately fit us in for a recording session” said Hull.

Zelena wrote the song because she remembered her father telling her of the Christmas story when she was young and it made an impression on her. One day when she wanted to start working on a new song and the memories of the Christmas Truce story was on her mind. Zelena said “why don’t I write something about it and come back again later, if I get stuck.” Two days later it was finished.
Edward said “When soldiers who are facing chemical weapons attacks, frostbite, starvation, and unimaginable horrors can stop fighting and respect each other it makes you wonder how different the world would be if we could follow their example.

Guns fire and bombs burst
Young men die of hunger and thirst
Innocence is now waning
Oh could it be a silent night 
Angels weep in heaven's light
Praying for all on either side
Waiting to see if the tide will subside

Unlike a fool you know I believe
Hope’s not lost so I cannot leave
Oh I can hear a silent night.
Unlike a fool you know I believe

Oh two arcs drawn on dead man’s land
Brother’s keeper take my hand
Maybe we can call each other friend
Maybe one day this war will end
You can only learn from past mistakes
There’s no way you can change the past

Unlike a fool you know I believe
Hope’s not lost so I cannot leave
Oh I can hear a silent night.
Unlike a fool you know I believe

Relationships can be tendentious at best. Sometimes you gotta leave some people behind if they bring you down. No wonder most marriages end in divorce. 🙂 Serious is Serious, evidently not everyone is about relationships. It takes two to make it work, not just one. This is a shredding rock song, in the vain of classic rock. It continually pumps you up, (I guess it makes you ready for that break up you’ve been dreading).

Hard to the core don’t care anymore
Then what are you coming here for?
Call me and apologize
Why can’t you realize
I try to reel it in
Try to fit in so n’ so’s skin
Even though you try to win
I’m gonna to do it again

I’m serious Like a heart attack
Yes, I’m serious Like a heart attack

There’s a long wait in the line, 
But you sadly out of time
Waiting on the road for you
Makes me wish a I never knew you
There’s a beating and it’s hurting
You’ve been flirting with fear
You think me mad well it’s so sad
I’m serious Like a heart attack
Yes, I’m serious Like a heart attack

I’m serious Like a heart attack
Yes, I’m serious 
I’m not turning back
